# Robot Gladiators

While going through Module 3 of bootcamp, I coded this application after reading the descriptions and following along with the code the module showed and explained to me.

## How It Works

It is a game played through window prompts where you can create a robot, battled three different opponents, sustain point reduction from attacks, inflict point reduction through attacks, get money from winning battles, and spend money on health or battle points in the in-game store.
